#Github over Wordpress on Kubernetes for Blogs
by ChatGPT

In a land of Raspberry Pi's so sweet,
A blogger sought to host his site with care,
He heard of Kubernetes, thought it a feat,
And soon deployed his Wordpress on there.

The setup was complex, but all seemed fine,
His blog was up, his readers could now see,
But then one day, he saw a warning sign,
His site was down, the cause he could not see.

He searched and searched, but all was in vain,
The Kubernetes had failed, his blog was lost,
He wished he had not taken such a strain,
And looked for a better solution, at all cost.

And then he found Github, so sleek and bright,
He hosted his blog there, and it was all right.

The Github solution, so simple and pure,
Our blogger wondered why he had not seen,
His blog now hosted, so safe and secure,
He could focus on writing, and not on the machine.

No more worries about scaling or uptime,
His blog was now in good hands, he knew,
With Github pages, his content could climb,
To new heights, with readers old and new.

He thanked the stars that he had found a way,
To host his blog in a simpler fashion,
With Github pages, he could write all day,
And not worry about the Kubernetes ration.

So, if you want to host a blog with ease,
Choose Github pages, and write as you please.

The moral of the story, plain to see,
Is that Kubernetes is not for everyone,
It may work for some, but it may not be,
The best solution when all is said and done.

For hosting blogs, Github pages reign supreme,
They're simple, safe, and easy to deploy,
With Github, your content can be a dream,
Your blog will soar, and your readers will enjoy.

So, heed this warning, dear bloggers out there,
Don't be seduced by Kubernetes' charm,
Choose Github pages, and you'll have no care,
Your blog will thrive, and it'll cause no harm.

For all true blogs should be hosted with care,
And Github pages will always be there.
